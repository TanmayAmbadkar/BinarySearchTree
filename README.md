# BinarySearchTree
This is a Binary Search Tree I created as a part of my Data Structures course. 

It contains the following functions:

1) insertion
2) deletion
3) searching
4) traversal (inorder, preorder and postorder)

I have uploaded a driver class, so that you can see how to use functions of the Binary Search Tree


# Theory
A Binary Search Tree is special Binary tree in which the elements are arranged according to their key value. If an element is greater than the root, it is placed to the right of the root, otherwise left.
